# Q2-FirstAssignment
## 1. Messages
The messages parameter defines the structure of the input for the Chat Completion API. It consists of a list of messages that simulate a conversation. Each message has a **role** (system, user, or assistant) and **content** (the actual text).  
- **System:** Provides instructions or context for the assistant (e.g., "You are a helpful assistant").  
- **User:** Represents the input from the user.  
- **Assistant:** Contains responses generated by the model.
- This structure helps maintain a conversation-like flow and allows the model to generate relevant responses based on context.
## 2. Model
The model parameter specifies which version of the OpenAI language model you want to use, such as gpt-3.5-turbo or gpt-4. Each model has different levels of performance, accuracy, and cost.
- For example, **GPT-3.5** is faster and cheaper, while **GPT-4** is more advanced and better at understanding complex prompts.
The model you choose impacts how well the API can process your input and provide accurate or creative responses, depending on the task.
