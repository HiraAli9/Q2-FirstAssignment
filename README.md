#1. Messages
The messages parameter defines the structure of the input for the Chat Completion API.It consists of a list of messages that simulate a conversation. Each message has a role (system, user, or assistant) and content (the actual text).
  
  System: Provides instructions or context for the assistant (e.g., "You are a helpful assistant").
User: Represents the input from the user.
Assistant: Contains responses generated by the model.
This structure helps maintain a conversation-like flow and allows the model to generate relevant responses based on context.
